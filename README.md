# groundstation

This is the code for the groundstation for my flight computer project. This is for a raspberry pi using an HC-12 antenna.

This code included sample output from the MARS avionics board. There is also a parser for the GPS to put it into coordinates you can paste into google maps. Still need to make a script to parse the automatically do this with the data, and a script to get altitude readings using the pressure.
